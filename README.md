# Asteroids-
This project served as one of the final programming exercises for 
the MOOC course from Helsinki in Java. It's also serving as my 
first personal project to work on outside of school, as well 
as the project I'll start to learn git/github with. The 
application as it is now is actually pretty primitive, my goal is to
make it more sophisticated.

As of now the plans are to:

Fix the lag that occurs when there are many objects on screen

Fix the amount of projectiles that can be shot

When a projectile collides with an asteroid, add animation
for the asteroid to "explode"

more that I can't think of right now.
